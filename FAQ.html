                    It’s important for us to provide complete transparency around our ingredient approach including our choice of fragrance raw materials.

                    After careful consideration and lots of research, we have chosen synthetic fragrances for our products over natural ones.
                    
                    Synthetic ingredients in fragrance allow the creation of more complex and unique signatures which is the main reason for this decision. We wanted to be able to create a fragrance that is a true reflection of our brand, that is instantly recognisable and loved.
                    
                    Safety
                    
                    All Plenaire fragrances comply with EU Cosmetic regulation and IFRA standards. The IFRA Standards form the basis for the globally accepted and recognized risk management system for the safe use of fragrance ingredients and are part of the IFRA Code of Practice. This is the self-regulating system of the industry, based on risk assessments carried out by an independent Expert Panel and supports the IFRA commitment to provide products that are safe for use by the consumer and to the environment.
                    
                    If you have very sensitive skin, it’s important to always patch test a product for 24 hours before choosing to invest in it.
                    
                    Synthetic versus Natural approaches to Fragrance
                    
                    Synthetic fragrances contain chemicals that are not of a natural origin while natural fragrances contain ingredients only from a natural origin- generally, this means essential oils. While a lot of synthetic fragrances contain parabens, phthalates and synthetic musks, it is entirely possible to create a synthetic fragrance without any of these materials, as we have achieved with our fragrance.
                    
                    It is important to mention that synthetic fragrances do not necessarily cause more allergic reactions than natural fragrance. Both of them contain ingredients called allergens – substances that cause allergies. Almost all essential oils contain allergens, and many are not suitable for all occasions, for example, during pregnancy or for babies.
                    
                    It is also not true that a natural fragrance is more sustainable than a synthetic one. In fact, the environmental impact of producing essential oils can often be higher when compared to synthetic perfumery ingredients.
                    
                    Plenaire signature
                    
                    Our products all contain a signature fragrance which we have developed in collaboration with a leading perfumery expert, here in the UK.
                    
                    Our perfumer, Jean Charles Mignon studied chemistry at the University of Poitiers and Le Havre and began his perfume career at the Grasse Institute of Perfumery before completing Perfumery School in Grasse under the guidance of Robertet Senior Perfumers Michel Almairac, Jean-Francois Latty and Jacques Flori.
                    
                    “When I was a child, my parents were florists so I was always in contact with flowers and gradually became familiar with the different species and their particular scents. My favourite smell has to be the rose (of course!) in part because of its richness, but also because of the power and impact this natural raw material delivers– there is nothing quite like it!"
                    
                    The Plenaire signature fragrance, entitled Innocent Mind opens with light notes of white nectarine, leading to a heart of rose, orris and violet on a base of clean vanilla and creamy musk.
                    
                    After balancing our key principles of safety, pleasure and sustainability, we are presenting this delicate signature in all of our products.
